### New terminal arguments

When opening a new pane or tab with a key binding, you can specify which profile is used by including the profile's name, guid, or index. If none are specified, the default profile is used. This can be done by adding `profile` or `index` as an argument to a `splitPane` or `newTab` key binding. Note that indexing starts at 0.

```json
{ "command": { "action": "splitPane", "split": "vertical", "profile": "profile1" }, "keys": "ctrl+a" },
{ "command": { "action": "splitPane", "split": "vertical", "profile": "{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}" }, "keys": "ctrl+b" },
{ "command": { "action": "newTab", "index": 0 }, "keys": "ctrl+c" }
```

Additionally, you can override certain aspects of the profile such as the profile's command line executable, starting directory, or tab title. This can be accomplished by adding `commandline`, `startingDirectory`, and/or `tabTitle` to a `splitPane` or `newTab` key binding.

```json
{ "command": { "action": "splitPane", "split": "auto", "profile": "profile1", "commandline": "foo.exe" }, "keys": "ctrl+a" },
{ "command": { "action": "newTab", "profile": "{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}", "startingDirectory": "C:\\foo" }, "keys": "ctrl+b" },
{ "command": { "action": "newTab", "index": 0, "tabTitle": "bar", "startingDirectory": "C:\\foo", "commandline": "foo.exe" }, "keys": "ctrl+c" }
```
