# Cascadia Code

Cascadia Code is a new monospaced font from Microsoft that provides a fresh experience for command-line applications and text editors. Microsoft developed Cascadia Code alongside Windows Terminal. Use this font with terminal applications and text editors such as Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code.

## Cascadia Code versions

You can choose from multiple versions of Cascadia Code that include ligatures and glyphs. Download all versions of Cascadia Code from the [Cascadia Code GitHub releases page](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code/releases). Windows Terminal ships with Cascadia Code and Cascadia Mono in its package and uses Cascadia Mono by default.

| Font Name | Includes Ligatures | Includes Powerline Glyphs |
| --------- | ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Cascadia Code | Yes | No |
| Cascadia Mono | No  | No |
| Cascadia Code PL | Yes | Yes |
| Cascadia Mono PL | No | Yes |

## Powerline and programming ligatures

Powerline is a common command-line plugin that allows you to display extra information in your prompt. It uses a few additional glyphs to display this information properly.

Programming ligatures are glyphs that are created by combining characters. They're most useful when writing code. The "Code" variants include ligatures, whereas the "Mono" variants exclude them.
