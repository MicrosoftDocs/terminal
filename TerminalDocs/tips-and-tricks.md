# Windows Terminal tips and tricks

## Rename a tab ([Windows Terminal Preview feature](https://aka.ms/terminal-preview/))

You can right click on a tab and select Rename Tab to rename a tab for that terminal session. Clicking this option in the context menu will change your tab title into a text field, where you can then edit the title. If you'd like to set the tab title for that profile for every terminal instance, you can learn more in the [Tab title tutorial](./tutorials/tab-title.md).
