# Theme settings in Windows Terminal ([Preview](https://aka.ms/terminal-preview))

The settings listed below affect the visuals of the terminal window itself, rather than the appearance of an individual tab/pane. These settings are currently only editable directly in the [settings.json file](../install.md#settings-json-file) and are not configurable via the settings UI.

```json
"theme": "dark"
"themes":
[
    // THEME OBJECTS
]
```

For some example themes, take a look at the [Themes gallery](./../custom-terminal-gallery/theme-gallery.md).

Each theme in the `themes` list is comprised of a collection of property objects, that specify the properties of individual elements of the application. For example, the default `"dark"` theme is the following:

```json
{
    "name": "dark",
    "window": {
        "applicationTheme": "dark"
    },
    "tab": {
        "background": "terminalBackground",
        "unfocusedBackground": "#00000000"
    },
    "tabRow": {
        "unfocusedBackground": "#333333FF"
    }
},
```

You may also configure the Terminal to use separate themes for light and dark mode in the OS and change automatically between those themes when the OS theme changes. To do this, specify the `theme` property as an object containing the keys `light` and `dark`:

```json
"theme": { "dark": "<Dark Theme Name>", "light": "<Light Theme Name>" },
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Specifying a pair of `light` and `dark` themes is only available in [Windows Terminal Preview](https://aka.ms/terminal-preview).

## Theme name

This is the name of the theme. Names should be unique. The names `dark`, `light`, and `system` are reserved for the built-in default themes.

**Property name:** `name`

**Necessity:** Required

**Accepts:** Name of theme as a string

<br />

___

## Window

These settings are used to configure the appearance of the whole of the window of the Terminal.

**Property name:** `window`

### Application theme

This sets the UI theme of the application. This will stylize items such as buttons, the command palette, and other application UI elements. It can either be light or dark. `"system"` will use the same theme as Windows.

**Property name:** `applicationTheme`

**Necessity:** Optional

**Accepts:** `"system"`, `"dark"`, `"light"`

**Default value:** `"dark"`

<br />

### Mica

This enables the Mica effect on this window, beneath all other UI layers. For Mica to be visible, the layers above it need to be transparent. As an example, to have a tab row with Mica in it you'll need to configure the alpha channel of the background to be `0` as follows:

```json
{
    "name": "My Mica Theme",
    "tab":
    {
        "background": "terminalBackground"
    },
    "tabRow":
    {
        "background": "#00000000"
    },
    "window":
    {
        "applicationTheme": "system",
        "useMica": true
    }
},
```

Note that when Mica is enabled for the window it is enabled under the entirety of the window, including as a backdrop for the Terminal panes in the window. This means that profiles which are using `opacity` without `useAcrylic` enabled will show through to the new Mica background. It is not currently possible to have a unblurred transparent background for the Terminal and a Mica background for the tabs / tab row simultaneously.

**Property name:** `useMica`

**Necessity:** Optional

**Accepts:** `true`, `false`

**Default value:** `false`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Mica is only available in [Windows Terminal Preview](https://aka.ms/terminal-preview).

> [!NOTE]
> Mica is only available on Windows builds >= 22621.

___

## Tab row

These settings are used to configure the appearance of the tab row. When `showTabsInTitlebar` is `true` (the default), this configures the title bar.

**Property name:** `tabRow`

### Background color

The color of the tab row when the window is in the foreground.

**Property name:** `background`

**Necessity:** Optional

**Accepts:** a [theme color](#theme-colors).

### Inactive background color

The color of the tab row when the window is inactive.

**Property name:** `unfocusedBackground`

**Necessity:** Optional

**Accepts:** a [theme color](#theme-colors).

<br />

___

## Tabs

These are settings that control the appearance of individual tabs in the Terminal.

**Property name:** `tab`

### Background color

The color of the active tab. Setting a `tabColor` in a profile will override this value. Similarly, setting a color at runtime with the tab color picker will override this color.

This color is always treated as a solid color, even if set to a `terminalBackground` of a pane with an acrylic background.

**Property name:** `background`

**Necessity:** Optional

**Accepts:** a [theme color](#theme-colors).

### Inactive background color

The color of inactive tabs. Setting a `tabColor` in a profile will override this value. Similarly, setting a color at runtime with the tab color picker will override this color.

This color is always treated as a solid color, even if set to a `terminalBackground` of a pane with an acrylic background.

When set to `terminalBackground` or `accent`, this will automatically use an alpha value of 30%, to be semi-transparent.

**Property name:** `unfocusedBackground`

**Necessity:** Optional

**Accepts:** a [theme color](#theme-colors).

### Show close button

Configures how the "close" button on the tab should appear. This accepts the following values:
* `"always"`: Always show tab close buttons.
* `"hover"`: Show the tab close button on the active tab, and any tabs that are hovered with the mouse.
* `"never"`: Never show tab close buttons. This also disables the ability to close the tab with the middle mouse button.
* `"activeOnly"`: Show the tab close button on the active tab only.

**Property name:** `showCloseButton`

**Necessity:** Optional

**Accepts:** `"always"`, `"hover"`, `"never"`, `"activeOnly"`

**Default value:** `"always"`

<br />

## Theme colors

The colors used in themes both accept RGBA color values, as well as a few special strings for custom values. The accepted values are as follows:

* `"#rgb`, `"#rrggbb`, `"#rrggbbaa`: An RGB color value. When the alpha chanel is omitted, these colors default to a fully opaque alpha channel.
* `"accent"`: This is a special value that means "the accent color set in the system settings".
* `"terminalBackground"`: This is a special value evaluated to mean "the background color of the active terminal pane". If there are multiple panes in a tab, then this is the color of the active one. This always uses the `background` of the profile - it ignores anything from a `backgroundImage`, if set.
