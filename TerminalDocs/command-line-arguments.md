# Using command line arguments for Windows Terminal

You can use `wt.exe` to open a new instance of Windows Terminal from the command line. You can also use the execution alias `wt` instead.

> [!NOTE]
> If you built Windows Terminal from the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal), you can open that build using `wtd.exe` or `wtd`.

## Command line syntax

The `wt` command line accepts two types of values: **options** and **commands**. **Options** are a list of flags and other parameters that can control the behavior of the `wt` command line as a whole. **Commands** provide the action, or list of actions separated by semicolons, that should be implemented. If no command is specified, then the command is assumed to be `new-tab` by default.

```cmd
wt [options] [command ; ]
```

To display a help message listing the available command line arguments, enter: `wt -h`, `wt --help`, `wt -?`, or `wt /?`.

## Options and commands

Below is the full list of supported commands and options for the `wt` command line.

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `--help`, `-h`, `-?`, `/?` | Displays the help message. |
| `--maximized`, `-M` | Launches the terminal maximized. |
| `--fullscreen`, `-F` | Launches the terminal as full screen. |
| `--focus`, `-f` | Launches the terminal in the focus mode. Can be combined with `maximized`. |
| `--window`, `-w` `<window-id>` | Launches the terminal in a specific window. |

| Command | Parameters | Description |
| ------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| `new-tab`, `nt` | `--profile, -p profile-name`, `--startingDirectory, -d starting-directory`, `commandline`, `--title`, `--tabColor` | Creates a new tab. |
| `split-pane`, `sp` | `-H, --horizontal`, `-V, --vertical`, `--profile, -p profile-name`, `--startingDirectory, -d starting-directory`, `--title`, `--tabColor`, `--size, -s size`, `commandline` | Splits a new pane. |
| `focus-tab`, `ft` | `--target, -t tab-index` | Focuses on a specific tab. |
| `move-focus`, `mf` | `direction` | Move focus between panes in the given direction. Accepts one of `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`. |

> [!NOTE]
> When opening Windows Terminal from cmd (Command Prompt), if you want to use your custom "cmd" profile settings, you will need to use the command `wt -p cmd`. Otherwise, to run your *default* profile settings, just use `wt cmd`.

## Command line argument examples

Commands may vary slightly depending on which command line you're using.

### Target a specific window

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `--window,-w` parameter accepts window names only in [Windows Terminal Preview](https://aka.ms/terminal-preview).

Below are examples of how to target specific windows using the `--window,-w` option.

<!-- Start tab selectors. -->
#### [Command Prompt](#tab/windows)

```cmd
// Open a new tab with the default profile in the current window
wt -w 0 nt

// Open a new tab in a new window with the default profile
wt -w -1 nt

// Open a new tab in the first-created terminal window with the default profile
wt -w 1 nt

// Open a new tab in the terminal window named foo with the default profile. If foo does not exist, create a new window named foo.
wt -w foo nt
```

#### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
// Open a new tab with the default profile in the current window
wt -w 0 nt

// Open a new tab in a new window with the default profile
wt -w -1 nt

// Open a new tab in the first-created terminal window with the default profile
wt -w 1 nt

// Open a new tab in the terminal window named foo with the default profile. If foo does not exist then, create a new window named foo.
wt -w foo nt
```

#### [Linux](#tab/linux)

```bash
// Open a new tab with the default profile in the current window
cmd.exe /c "wt.exe" -w 0 nt

// Open a new tab in a new window with the default profile
cmd.exe /c "wt.exe" -w -1 nt

// Open a new tab in the first-created terminal window with the default profile
cmd.exe /c "wt.exe" -w 1 nt

// Open a new tab in the terminal window named foo with the default profile. If foo does not exist then, create a new window named foo.
cmd.exe /c "wt.exe" -w foo nt
```

Execution aliases do not work in WSL distributions. If you want to use wt.exe from a WSL command line, you can spawn it from CMD directly by running `cmd.exe`. The `/c` option tells CMD to terminate after running.

---
<!-- End tab selectors.  -->

### Open a new profile instance

To open a new terminal instance, in this case the command will open the profile named "Ubuntu-18.04", enter:

<!-- Start tab selectors. -->
#### [Command Prompt](#tab/windows)

```cmd
wt -p "Ubuntu-18.04"
```

#### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
wt -p "Ubuntu-18.04"
```

#### [Linux](#tab/linux)

```bash
cmd.exe /c "wt.exe" -p "Ubuntu-18.04"
```

Execution aliases do not work in WSL distributions. If you want to use wt.exe from a WSL command line, you can spawn it from CMD directly by running `cmd.exe`. The `/c` option tells CMD to terminate after running.

---
<!-- End tab selectors.  -->

The `-p` flag is used to specify the Windows Terminal profile that should be opened. Substitute "Ubuntu-18.04" with the name of any terminal profile that you have installed. This will always open a new window. Windows Terminal is not yet capable of opening new tabs or panes in an existing instance.

### Target a directory

To specify the folder that should be used as the starting directory for the console, in this case the d:\ directory, enter:

<!-- Start tab selectors. -->
#### [Command Prompt](#tab/windows)

```cmd
wt -d d:\
```

#### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
wt -d d:\
```

#### [Linux](#tab/linux)

```bash
cmd.exe /c "wt.exe" -d d:\
```

Execution aliases do not work in WSL distributions. If you want to use wt.exe from a WSL command line, you can spawn it from CMD directly by running `cmd.exe`. The `/c` option tells CMD to terminate after running.

---
<!-- End tab selectors.  -->

### Multiple tabs

To open a new terminal instance with multiple tabs, enter:

<!-- Start tab selectors. -->
#### [Command Prompt](#tab/windows)

```cmd
wt ; ;
```

#### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
wt `; `;
```

PowerShell uses a semicolon ; to delimit statements. To interpret a semicolon ; as a command delimiter for wt command-line arguments, you need to escape semicolon characters using backticks. PowerShell also has the stop parsing operator (--%), which instructs it to stop interpreting anything after it and just pass it on verbatim.

#### [Linux](#tab/linux)

```bash
cmd.exe /c "wt.exe" \; \;
```

Execution aliases do not work in WSL distributions. If you want to use wt.exe from a WSL command line, you can spawn it from CMD directly by running `cmd.exe`. The `/c` option tells CMD to terminate after running.

---
<!-- End tab selectors.  -->

To open a new terminal instance with multiple tabs, in this case a Command Prompt profile and a PowerShell profile, enter:

<!-- Start tab selectors. -->
#### [Command Prompt](#tab/windows)

```cmd
wt -p "Command Prompt" ; new-tab -p "Windows PowerShell"
```

#### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
wt -p "Command Prompt" `; new-tab -p "Windows PowerShell"
```

PowerShell uses a semicolon ; to delimit statements. To interpret a semicolon ; as a command delimiter for wt command-line arguments, you need to escape semicolon characters using backticks. PowerShell also has the stop parsing operator (--%), which instructs it to stop interpreting anything after it and just pass it on verbatim.

#### [Linux](#tab/linux)

```bash
cmd.exe /c "wt.exe" -p "Command Prompt" \; new-tab -p "Windows PowerShell"
```

Execution aliases do not work in WSL distributions. If you want to use wt.exe from a WSL command line, you can spawn it from CMD directly by running `cmd.exe`. The `/c` option tells CMD to terminate after running and the `\;` backslash + semicolon separates commands.

---
<!-- End tab selectors.  -->

### Multiple panes

To open a new terminal instance with one tab containing three panes running a Command Prompt profile, a PowerShell profile, and your default profile running a WSL command line, enter:

<!-- Start tab selectors. -->
#### [Command Prompt](#tab/windows)

```cmd
wt -p "Command Prompt" ; split-pane -p "Windows PowerShell" ; split-pane -H wsl.exe
```

#### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
wt -p "Command Prompt" `; split-pane -p "Windows PowerShell" `; split-pane -H wsl.exe
```

PowerShell uses a semicolon ; to delimit statements. To interpret a semicolon ; as a command delimiter for wt command-line arguments, you need to escape semicolon characters using backticks. PowerShell also has the stop parsing operator (--%), which instructs it to stop interpreting anything after it and just pass it on verbatim.

#### [Linux](#tab/linux)

```bash
cmd.exe /c "wt.exe" -p "Command Prompt" \; split-pane -p "Windows PowerShell" \; split-pane -H wsl.exe
```

Execution aliases do not work in WSL distributions. If you want to use wt.exe from a WSL command line, you can spawn it from CMD directly by running `cmd.exe`. The `/c` option tells CMD to terminate after running and the `\;` backslash + semicolon separates commands.

---
<!-- End tab selectors.  -->

The `-H` flag (or `--horizontal`) indicates that you would like the panes to be split horizontally. The `-V` flag (or `--vertical`) indicates that you would like the panes split vertically.

### Multiple tabs and panes

The `new-tab` and `split-pane` commands can be sequenced to get multiple tabs, each with split panes. To open a new terminal instance with two tabs, each with two panes running a Command Prompt and a WSL command line, with each tab in a different directory, enter:

<!-- Start tab selectors. -->
#### [Command Prompt](#tab/windows)

```cmd
wt -p "Command Prompt" ; split-pane -V wsl.exe ; new-tab -d c:\ ; split-pane -H -d c:\ wsl.exe
```

#### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
wt -p "Command Prompt" `; split-pane -V wsl.exe `; new-tab -d c:\ `; split-pane -H -d c:\ wsl.exe
```

PowerShell uses a semicolon ; to delimit statements. To interpret a semicolon ; as a command delimiter for wt command-line arguments, you need to escape semicolon characters using backticks. PowerShell also has the stop parsing operator (--%), which instructs it to stop interpreting anything after it and just pass it on verbatim.

#### [Linux](#tab/linux)

```bash
cmd.exe /c "wt.exe" -p "Command Prompt" \; split-pane -V wsl.exe \; new-tab -d c:\\ \; split-pane -H -d c:\\ wsl.exe
```

Execution aliases do not work in WSL distributions. If you want to use wt.exe from a WSL command line, you can spawn it from CMD directly by running `cmd.exe`. The `/c` option tells CMD to terminate after running and the `\;` backslash + semicolon separates commands.  Note to specify a Windows directory as the starting directory for `wsl.exe` that two backslashes `\\` are required.

---
<!-- End tab selectors.  -->

### Tab title

To open a new terminal instance with custom tab titles, use the `--title` argument. To set the title of each tab when opening two tabs, enter:

<!-- Start tab selectors. -->
#### [Command Prompt](#tab/windows)

```cmd
wt --title tabname1 ; new-tab -p "Ubuntu-18.04" --title tabname2
```

#### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
wt --title tabname1 `; new-tab -p "Ubuntu-18.04" --title tabname2
```

#### [Linux](#tab/linux)

```bash
cmd.exe /c "wt.exe" --title tabname1 \; new-tab -p "Ubuntu-18.04" --title tabname2
```

Execution aliases do not work in WSL distributions. If you want to use wt.exe from a WSL command line, you can spawn it from CMD directly by running `cmd.exe`. The `/c` option tells CMD to terminate after running and the `\;` forward-slash + semicolon separates commands.

---
<!-- End tab selectors.  -->

### Using application title ([Preview](https://aka.ms/terminal-preview))

To open a new terminal instance allowing applications within it to set the tab title by sending title change messages, use the `--useApplicationTitle` flag. To suppress these messages, use the `--suppressApplicationTitle` flag. If none of these flags are provided, the behavior is inherited from the profile's settings. To open a tab with title `tabname` that will not be overridden by the application, enter:

<!-- Start tab selectors. -->
#### [Command Prompt](#tab/windows)

```cmd
wt --title tabname --suppressApplicationTitle
```

#### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
wt --title tabname --suppressApplicationTitle
```

#### [Linux](#tab/linux)

```bash
cmd.exe /c "wt.exe" --title tabname --suppressApplicationTitle
```

Execution aliases do not work in WSL distributions. If you want to use wt.exe from a WSL command line, you can spawn it from CMD directly by running `cmd.exe`. The `/c` option tells CMD to terminate after running and the `\;` backslash + semicolon separates commands.

---
<!-- End tab selectors.  -->

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is only available in [Windows Terminal Preview](https://aka.ms/terminal-preview).

### Tab color

To open a new terminal instance with custom tab colors, use the `--tabColor` argument. This argument overrides the value defined in the profile, but can be overridden as well using the tab color picker. In the following example, a new terminal is created with two tabs of different colors:

<!-- Start tab selectors. -->
#### [Command Prompt](#tab/windows)

```cmd
wt --tabColor #009999 ; new-tab --tabColor #f59218
```

#### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
wt --tabColor #009999 ; new-tab --tabColor #f59218
```

#### [Linux](#tab/linux)

```bash
cmd.exe /c "wt.exe" --tabColor #009999 \; new-tab --tabColor #f59218
```

Execution aliases do not work in WSL distributions. If you want to use wt.exe from a WSL command line, you can spawn it from CMD directly by running `cmd.exe`. The `/c` option tells CMD to terminate after running and `\;` separates commands.

---
<!-- End tab selectors.  -->

When `--tabColor` is set for a tab, it is associated with the first pane of this tab. Hence in a tab with multiple panes, the color will be applied only if the first pane is in focus. To set the tab color for additional panes, you will need to add the `--tabColor` parameter to the `split-pane` subcommand as well. In the example below, a tab with two panes is created with tab colors specified for each pane:

```powershell
wt new-tab --tabColor #009999 ; split-pane --tabColor #f59218
```

### Tab focus

To open a new terminal instance with a specific tab in focus, use the `-t` flag (or `--target`), along with the tab-index number. To open your default profile in the first tab and the "Ubuntu-18.04" profile focused in the second tab (`-t 1`), enter:

<!-- Start tab selectors. -->
#### [Command Prompt](#tab/windows)

```cmd
wt ; new-tab -p "Ubuntu-18.04" ; focus-tab -t 1
```

#### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
wt `; new-tab -p "Ubuntu-18.04" `; focus-tab -t 1
```

#### [Linux](#tab/linux)

```bash
cmd.exe /c "wt.exe" \; new-tab -p "Ubuntu-18.04" \; focus-tab -t 1
```

Execution aliases do not work in WSL distributions. If you want to use wt.exe from a WSL command line, you can spawn it from CMD directly by running `cmd.exe`. The `/c` option tells CMD to terminate after running and the `\;` backslash + semicolon separates commands.

---
<!-- End tab selectors.  -->

## Examples of multiple commands from PowerShell

Windows Terminal uses the semicolon character `;` as a delimiter for separating commands in the `wt` command line. Unfortunately, PowerShell also uses `;` as a command separator. To work around this, you can use the following tricks to run multiple `wt` commands from PowerShell. In all the following examples, a new terminal window is created with three panes - one running Command Prompt, one with PowerShell, and the last one running WSL.

The following examples use the `Start-Process` command to run `wt`. For more information on why the terminal uses `Start-Process`, see [Using start](#using-start) below.

### Single quoted parameters

In this example, the `wt` parameters are wrapped in single quotes (`'`). This syntax is useful if nothing is being calculated.

```powershell
start wt 'new-tab "cmd" ; split-pane -p "Windows PowerShell" ; split-pane -H wsl.exe'
```

### Escaped quotes

When passing a value contained in a variable to the `wt` command line, use the following syntax:

```powershell
$ThirdPane = "wsl.exe"
start wt "new-tab cmd ; split-pane -p `"Windows PowerShell`" ; split-pane -H $ThirdPane"
```

Note the usage of  `` ` `` to escape the double-quotes (`"`) around "Windows PowerShell" in the `-p` parameter to the `split-pane` parameter.

### Using `start`

All the above examples explicitly used `start` to launch the terminal.

The following examples do not use `start` to run the command line. Instead, there are two other methods of escaping the command line:

* Only escaping the semicolons so that `PowerShell` will ignore them and pass them straight to `wt`.
* Using `--%`, so PowerShell will treat the rest of the command line as arguments to the application.

```powershell
wt new-tab "cmd" `; split-pane -p "Windows PowerShell" `; split-pane -H wsl.exe
```

```powershell
wt --% new-tab cmd ; split-pane -p "Windows PowerShell" ; split-pane -H wsl.exe
```

In both of these examples, the newly created Windows Terminal window will create the window by correctly parsing all the provided command-line arguments.

However, these methods are _not_ recommended currently, as PowerShell will wait for the newly-created terminal window to be closed before returning control to PowerShell. By default, PowerShell will always wait for Windows Store applications (like Windows Terminal) to close before returning to the prompt. Note that this is different than the behavior of Command Prompt, which will return to the prompt immediately.
