# Dynamic profiles in Windows Terminal

Windows Terminal automatically creates Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and PowerShell profiles if you install these shells on your machine. This feature makes it easier for you to include all of your shells in the terminal without having to locate their executable files. The terminal generates these profiles with the `source` property, which tells the terminal where to find the proper executable.

When you install the terminal, it sets PowerShell as your default profile. To learn how to change your default profile, visit the [Startup page](./customize-settings/startup.md).

## Install a new shell after installing Windows Terminal

Regardless of whether you install a new shell before or after your terminal installation, the terminal creates a new profile for the newly installed shell.

## Hide a profile

To hide a profile from your terminal dropdown menu, add the `hidden` property to the profile object in your [settings.json file](./install.md#settings-json-file) and set it to `true`.

```json
"hidden": true
```

## Prevent a profile from being generated

To prevent the terminal from generating a dynamic profile, add the profile generator to the `disabledProfileSources` array in your global settings. For more information, see the [Global settings page](./customize-settings/startup.md#disable-dynamic-profiles).

```json
"disabledProfileSources": ["Windows.Terminal.Wsl", "Windows.Terminal.Azure", "Windows.Terminal.PowershellCore", "Windows.Terminal.SSH"]
```

## Add a third party profile

If a third party command line tool doesn't have a profile auto-generated in your [settings.json file](./install.md#settings-json-file), you can add it manually. The following profiles are for a few common third party tools for your reference.

### Anaconda

Assuming that you've installed Anaconda into `%USERPROFILE%\Anaconda3`:

```json
{
    "commandline": "cmd.exe /k \"%USERPROFILE%\\Anaconda3\\Scripts\\activate.bat %USERPROFILE%\\Anaconda3\"",
    "icon": "%USERPROFILE%\\Anaconda3\\Menu\\anaconda-navigator.ico",
    "name": "Anaconda3",
    "startingDirectory": "%USERPROFILE%"
}
```

### cmder

Assuming that you've installed cmder into `%CMDER_ROOT%`:

```json
{
    "commandline": "cmd.exe /k %CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\\init.bat",
    "name": "cmder",
    "icon": "%CMDER_ROOT%\\icons\\cmder.ico",
    "startingDirectory": "%USERPROFILE%"
}
```

### Cygwin

Assuming that you've installed Cygwin into `C:\cygwin64`:

```json
{
    "name": "Cygwin",
    "commandline": "C:\\cygwin64\\bin\\bash --login -i",
    "icon": "C:\\cygwin64\\Cygwin.ico",
    "startingDirectory": "C:\\cygwin64\\bin"
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The starting directory of Cygwin is set in order for the path
to work. The default directory opened when starting Cygwin will be `$HOME` because
of the `--login` flag.

### Far Manager

Assuming that you've installed Far into `c:\Program Files\Far Manager`:

```json
{
    "name": "Far",
    "commandline": "\"c:\\program files\\far manager\\far.exe\"",
    "startingDirectory": "%USERPROFILE%",
    "useAcrylic": false
},
```

### Git Bash

Assuming that you've installed Git Bash into `C:\\Program Files\\Git`:

```json
{
    "name": "Git Bash",
    "commandline": "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe -li",
    "icon": "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\mingw64\\share\\git\\git-for-windows.ico",
    "startingDirectory": "%USERPROFILE%"
}
````

### Git Bash (WOW64)

Assuming that you installed Git Bash into `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git`:

```json
{
    "name": "Git Bash",
    "commandline": "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe -li",
    "icon": "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\\Git\\mingw32\\share\\git\\git-for-windows.ico",
    "startingDirectory": "%USERPROFILE%"
}
```

### MSYS2

Assuming that you installed MSYS2 into `C:\\msys64`:

```json
{
    "name": "MSYS2",
    "commandline": "C:\\msys64\\msys2_shell.cmd -defterm -no-start -mingw64",
    "icon": "C:\\msys64\\msys2.ico",
    "startingDirectory": "C:\\msys64\\home\\user"
}
```
