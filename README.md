## Data Collection and Telemetry

Windows Terminal collects usage data and sends it to Microsoft to help improve the product. This telemetry data helps us understand how the Terminal is being used and identify areas for improvement. The data collected is subject to the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement).

### What data is collected?

The data collected includes information such as:
- Feature usage and performance metrics
- Crash and error reports
- Configurations and settings (in aggregate form)

This data is anonymized and does not include personal information or the content of your terminal sessions.

### How to disable telemetry

Telemetry collection in Windows Terminal is controlled by the Windows diagnostic data settings. To disable telemetry data collection:

1. Open **Settings** in Windows
2. Go to **Privacy & security** > **Diagnostics & feedback**
3. Set **Diagnostic data** to **Required diagnostic data** (the minimum setting)

Alternatively, you can completely disable diagnostic data collection on Windows, which will also disable telemetry for Windows Terminal. For more information about managing diagnostic data in Windows, see [Diagnostics, feedback, and privacy in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/diagnostics-feedback-and-privacy-in-windows-28808a2b-a31b-dd73-dcd3-4559a5199319).

For more information about data collection and privacy, please review the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement).
